In labor-intensive industries, effective employment is often a topic of discussion, as the production of goods is highly dependent on the productivity of individual workers. Particularly, a common issue in these industries is that the actual productivity of employees does not meet the target productivity, and thus can result in substantial loss in profitability. In this research, the garment industry was selected to find the relationship between productivity and employees. With the selected data, we propose an inferential question: How do various external factors relate to the productivity of employees in the garment industry?
